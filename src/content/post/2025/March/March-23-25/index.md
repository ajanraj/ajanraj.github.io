## Summary of "How I Use LLM" by Andrej Karpathy

Today I watched Andrej Karpathy's insightful YouTube video titled "How I Use LLM". For those who don't know, Karpathy is one of the leading figures in AI research, having worked at OpenAI, Tesla, and contributed significantly to the development of modern deep learning approaches.

The video offers a fascinating glimpse into how someone deeply involved in AI development actually uses these tools in their daily workflow. Here are the key points that stood out to me:

### Prompt Engineering Approach

Karpathy emphasizes the importance of clear, specific prompts when working with LLMs. Rather than vague requests, he structures his prompts with:

- Context about what he's trying to accomplish
- Specific instructions on the expected format of the response
- Examples of desired outputs when appropriate
- Clear constraints to limit the model's creativity when needed

### Use Cases in His Daily Work

What I found most valuable was seeing the practical applications:

- **Code assistance**: Using LLMs to explain unfamiliar codebases, generate unit tests, and debug issues
- **Writing assistance**: Outlining documents, improving clarity, and restructuring text
- **Learning tool**: Exploring new concepts by asking the model to explain them in different ways
- **Brainstorming partner**: Generating alternative approaches to problems

### Limitations and Pitfalls

Karpathy is refreshingly honest about where LLMs fall short:

- The need to verify factual claims
- The tendency for models to confidently present incorrect information
- Areas where specialized tools still outperform general-purpose LLMs

## My Reflections

What struck me most was Karpathy's pragmatic approach. He neither overhypes LLMs as magic solutions nor dismisses them as mere toys. Instead, he integrates them thoughtfully into his workflow, playing to their strengths while remaining aware of their limitations.

I've been experimenting with some of his techniques in my own work, particularly:

1. Using more structured prompts with clear formatting instructions
2. Treating the LLM as a collaborative partner rather than an oracle
3. Being more explicit about the context and background when asking questions

The results have been noticeably better - more relevant responses, less time spent reformulating questions, and fewer instances of the model confidently asserting incorrect information.

## Key Takeaway

If I had to distill the video to a single insight, it would be this: LLMs are most valuable when used as thinking tools that extend your capabilities rather than replace them. They excel at helping you explore possibilities, understand complex information, and augment your creative process - but the human remains essential for judgment, fact-checking, and critical thinking.
