## Quote for the day:

> We work so hard to get to where we are, only to feel like we're not there yet. Embrace how far you've come. The little things matter. This is a sign for you to never give up and give yourself credit.

## Encrypted

- Trying something new. I always wanted to Journal but since its personal, I really didn't want to post it as it is. So trying something new with encryption and decryption.
- I encrypted it with my public key.
- So it's now some gibberish and I can only decode it.
- Best of luck to anyone who try to decode it.
