			I’m Ajan. When I'm not busy being a coding wizard or winning accolades in tech, you'll find me
			battling in virtual worlds, wandering in unknown places with my camera in hand, or learning
			something new just for the fun of it. My travel tales are as colorful as my code, and every
			photograph I take has a story as complex as my algorithms. It's all about finding the perfect
			balance between pixels, places, and programming!
